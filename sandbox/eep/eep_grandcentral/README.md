# Cupboard/sandbox/eep/eep_grandcentral

This directory contains the EEP EEPROM programmer source code targeted at the Adafruit M4 Grand Central board. Like other EEP applications, it uses a simple text-based interface that's compatible with both direct interaction and attachment by a client application (see eep_client.py).
